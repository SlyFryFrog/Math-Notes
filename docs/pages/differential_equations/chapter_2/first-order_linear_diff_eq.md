# 2.2: First-Order Linear Differential Equations (Including Bernoulli Equations)

### Key Concepts
- **Bernoulli Equation**: A nonlinear equation of the form:
  $$
  \frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)y^n
  $$
  Solved by substitution: $ v = y^{1-n} $.

### Practice Problems
Solve the following Bernoulli equations:

1. $ \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{y}{t} = y^3 t^2 $
2. $ \frac{dy}{dt} + 2ty = ty^4 $

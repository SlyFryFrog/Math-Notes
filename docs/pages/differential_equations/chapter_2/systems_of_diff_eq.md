# 2.6: Systems of Differential Equations

### Key Concepts
- **System of Differential Equations**: A set of equations involving multiple functions and their derivatives.
  Example:
  $$
  \frac{dx}{dt} = f(t, x, y), \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = g(t, x, y)
  $$

### Practice Problems
Write the system of differential equations for the following scenarios:

1. Predator-prey model with populations $ x(t) $ and $ y(t) $.
2. Two tanks with different salt concentrations connected by a pipe.

# 2.5: Logistic Differential Equation

### Key Concepts
- **Logistic Growth Model**:
  $$
  \frac{dP}{dt} = rP \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)
  $$
  where $ r $ is the growth rate and $ K $ is the carrying capacity.

### **Practice Problems**
Solve the following logistic differential equations:

1. $ \frac{dP}{dt} = 0.02P(1 - \frac{P}{1000}) $, $ P(0) = 100 $
2. $ \frac{dP}{dt} = 0.05P(1 - \frac{P}{500}) $, $ P(0) = 50 $

# 2.4: Linear Models - Mixing and Cooling

### **Key Concepts**
- **Mixing Problems**: Model the amount of substance in a tank over time.
  Example: $ \frac{dA}{dt} = \text{rate in} - \text{rate out} $

- **Newton's Law of Cooling**:
  $$
  \frac{dT}{dt} = k(T - T_{\text{env}})
  $$

### Practice Problems
1. A tank initially contains 100 liters of water with 20 grams of salt. A solution with 0.1 g/L of salt enters at 5 L/min, and the well-stirred mixture exits at the same rate. Find the amount of salt in the tank at any time $ t $.

2. An object cools from 100°C to 60°C in 10 minutes in a room at 20°C. Find its temperature as a function of time.

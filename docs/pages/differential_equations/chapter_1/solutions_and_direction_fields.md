# **1.2: Solutions and Direction Fields**

### **Key Concepts**
- **Differential Equation**: An equation involving a function and its derivatives.
  Example: $ \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y) $

- **Solution**: A function $ y(t) $ that satisfies the differential equation for all $ t $ in an interval.

- **Direction Field**: A graphical representation of the slopes of solutions to a differential equation at various points in the $ ty $-plane.

### **Practice Problems**
Solve or sketch the direction field for the following differential equations:

1. $ \frac{dy}{dt} = t - y $
2. $ \frac{dy}{dt} = 2ty $
3. $ \frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 - t $

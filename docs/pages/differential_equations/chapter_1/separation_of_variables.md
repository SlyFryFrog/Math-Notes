# **1.3: Separation of Variables**

### **Key Concepts**
- **Separable Equation**: A differential equation that can be written as:
  $$
  \frac{dy}{dt} = g(t)h(y)
  $$
  Solved by integrating both sides after separation:
  $$
  \int \frac{1}{h(y)} \, dy = \int g(t) \, dt
  $$

### **Practice Problems**
Solve the following separable differential equations:

1. $ \frac{dy}{dt} = ty $
2. $ \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{y}{t} $
3. $ \frac{dy}{dt} = e^{t+y} $
